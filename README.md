## Description:
There are two .ipynb files in this folder. 
lighten-sharpen-crop.ipynb —— Used on Kaggle to preprocess the images.
Kaggle_Blocks_Alan_Li_Game_of_Towers.ipynb —— Used on Colab to train the model.

There are two datasets I uploaded to Kaggle:
kaggle datasets download -d alaaanlee/lighter-img
kaggle datasets download -d alaaanlee/sharper

The sharper datasets is based on the lighter-img one. 
Both are public. Please email Alan Li (Xiaomeng.Li@wustl.edu) if there are access issues.
